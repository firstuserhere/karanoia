<h1>About</h1>
<p>
Hi, I'm Kunvar. I'm a machine learning engineer. I love training neural networks of various forms and understanding how they work (<a href="https://mechinterp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mechanistic interpretability</a>).
</p>
<p>
I love nature and spend a lot of time exploring Google Earth and Street View, and learning how various cultures shaped our world. I enjoy playing Geoguessr and often listen to radio stations from around the world via <a href="https://radio.garden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radio Garden</a> while I'm working.
</p>
<p>
I love exploring places on foot or by bike, and talking to strangers about life in their city. When I first visited Manhattan, I walked from the Met Coisters down to the Battery park, walking the broadway, and talking to dozens of people along the way (literally). I'm drawn to beautiful architecture. I loved the aesthetic Vienna has.
</p>
<p>
I'm a big fan of nightwalking. I've found that people out at night usually have fun stories to share. I love the night in general, and looking up at the stars.
</p>
<p>
I'm fascinated by history, mythology, and how different cultures have shaped our world. My favorite has been Greek mythology since I was about 10 years old, but I also enjoy Roman, Norse, and Mahabharata stories.
</p>
<p>
I run regularly, lift weights, and absolutely love hiking up mountains. You can find most of my activities on my <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/111945782" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Strava</a>. I played for my college's squash team and also for the badminton team. I still enjoy playing both sports occassionally. </p>

<p>I also enjoy football (soccer) - I started watching football in 2009, and really fell in love with the sport during the 2010 world cup. My first favourite player was David Villa of Spain, and I started watching Barcelona due to him, Busquets and Xavi (and been a supporter since). I started watching Tennis around 2012, fell in love with Rafa and have been fortunate enough to see the big 3 play. Agassi's Open is one of my favorite books of all time. 
</p>
<p>
    I've always been a voracious reader. I used to read widely. I averaged reading 1.5 books a week (5+ books per month) from 2019-2022, and ~3 books a month from 2022-2025. Most of the books I read, I read only once. Never twice. I liked certain books, ideas, and concepts, but over time I forgot themâ€”I remembered the essence, but not the detail. I would meet new people and be unable to talk in-depth about the things I have really enjoyed. It started feeling increasingly shallow. Over time, I became increasingly and intensely dissatisfied with my understanding of the world, including my inner world.
</p>
<p>
 Now, I want to engage more deeply with the world, develop a more thorough understanding, and immerse myself completely with few things I do consume. As a result of that, I've reduced my reading of books significantly, and have been re-reading some high-quality books I've previously read, and really taking in the impact those books have on me. I log books I read on my <a href="https://goodreads.com/firstuserhere" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">goodreads</a>.

I often go by the username "firstuserhere" on the internet. You can find more of my <a href="https://firstuserhere.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">socials here</a>.
