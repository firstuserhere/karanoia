                    Hi, I'm Kunvar. I'm a machine learning engineer. I often go by the username "firstuserhere" on the internet. 
                </p>

                <p>I’ve always been a voracious reader. I used to read widely. I averaged reading 1.5 books a week (5+books per month) from 2019-2022, and ~3 books a month from 2022-2025. 

                <p>Most of the books I read, I read only once. Never twice. I liked certain books, ideas, and concepts, but over time I forgot them - I remembered the essence, but not the detail. I would meet new people and be unable to talk in-depth about the things I have really enjoyed. It started feeling increasingly shallow. Over time, I became increasingly and intensely dissatisfied with my understanding of the world, including my inner world. 
                </p>
                <p>I have been good at making good predictions about the world, without really understanding why I made those predictions. Now, I want to engage more deeply with the world, develop a more thorough understanding, and immerse myself completely with few things I do consume. As a result of that, I’ve reduced my reading of books significantly, and have been re-reading some high-quality books I’ve previously read, and really taking in the impact those books have on me.
                    
                    
                </p>
