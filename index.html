            <p>The terror of the blank page, which can feel both liberating and confining. This is a space for my quick takes, project details, and thoughts in progress.</p>

            <p><b>Take: On the simplicity of static websites.</b> I believe there's a renewed appreciation for simple, fast, and durable websites built with plain HTML and CSS. They are a counterpoint to the complexity of modern web development and offer a sense of ownership and longevity. <em>(Published: June 8, 2025)</em></p>
            
            <p><b>Project: This very website.</b> Built with simple HTML/CSS and hosted on GitHub Pages under the domain <a href="https://kunvarthaman.com" target="_blank">kunvarthaman.com</a>. The goal was to create a low-maintenance digital garden. You can view the source on <a href="https://github.com/firstuserhere/karanoia.github.io" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
