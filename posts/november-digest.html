If you can, <a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/">you should negotiate your salary</a>. And maybe put more thought into what you wear, because <a href="https://taliasable.substack.com/p/learning-fashion-like-an-engineer">Fashion is Character design</a>, but <a href="https://fatherkarine.substack.com/p/the-anti-cosmetic-surgery-essay-every">stay away from plastic surgery</a>.</p>

This is bad. <a href="https://andymasley.substack.com/p/please-please-please-do-not-ban-autonomous">Please do not ban autonomous vehicles in your city</a>. AVs are incredibly safe.
